React Native looks awesome and I was seeking for a real world project idea in which I can test drive
it and I came up with this. It's gonna be yet another photo sharing app. Plan is to have a Rails API
but at some point I plan to switch it up for Elixir based API (Phoenix most likely).

## Features

* As a user I want to be able to add a picture with its description and title [ ]
* As a user I want to see other peoples pictures [ ]
* As a user I want to be able to "like" a particular picture
